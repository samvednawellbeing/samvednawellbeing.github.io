Have you ever felt unworthy? Have you ever felt consumed by anxiety or panic attacks? I have.</p>\n<p>Since childhood, I’ve been an avid reader. As a child, I was living a life of denial. I used to hide behind the books. I was told to aspire and dream within boundaries. Although I was a bright student in academics, I didn’t know what to do in my life. Under peer pressure and family’s influence, I pursued my career in Chartered Accountancy and Company secretary. I cleared both the stages of CA in the first attempt but only in the final year of my internship and job experience in Pune I hit the rock bottom and realized, this is not what I can do my whole life. I was frustrated and completely lost.</p>\n<p>I returned to my city and stayed in depression for months, unable to find meaning in life. I’m grateful for that night when I was exploring on the internet something I can do worthwhile. I got to know about the vacancy in the only IB school of Surat which strives for change in the education system. That was the platform where I started questioning everything I thought I knew about life. I questioned my existence, religion and everything around me.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 660px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 67.87878787878788%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/c9b55/notepad.webp 165w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/f2908/notepad.webp 330w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/cc661/notepad.webp 660w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/a66df/notepad.webp 990w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/d33d4/notepad.webp 1320w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/e72c3/notepad.webp 3000w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/27f9f/notepad.jpg 165w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/80fc7/notepad.jpg 330w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/ee745/notepad.jpg 660w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/4017f/notepad.jpg 990w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/be3c7/notepad.jpg 1320w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/12609/notepad.jpg 3000w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/ee745/notepad.jpg\"\n            alt=\"The story behind Samvedna Wellbeing\"\n            title=\"The story behind [Samvedna Wellbeing](https://samvednawellbeing.org/).\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\"><p>The story behind <a href=\"https://samvednawellbeing.org/\">Samvedna Wellbeing</a>.</p></figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>So much of the root of the cause of our suffering has come from being conditioned in environments where our realities are denied. For a long time, I thought I was an expert at coping in my life. What made me feel this way was my ability to lie to myself and dwell in denial. In return, I was making decisions rooted in fear, insecurity, and old wounds. I was in a vicious cycle of coping and self-sabotage.</p>\n<p>As I was always fascinated with psychology readings to know myself, to know how these thoughts, feelings and emotions work. I took a huge leap of courage to drop all my previous pursuits and embark on the journey of self-exploration. I contemplated my solo travels and quiet times. I decided to seek help, to experience the therapy, how it can be helpful in my trauma recovery of early childhood.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 660px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 150.3030303030303%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/c9b55/laptop.webp 165w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/f2908/laptop.webp 330w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/cc661/laptop.webp 660w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/a66df/laptop.webp 990w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/d33d4/laptop.webp 1320w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/26eaf/laptop.webp 3648w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/27f9f/laptop.jpg 165w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/80fc7/laptop.jpg 330w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/ee745/laptop.jpg 660w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/4017f/laptop.jpg 990w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/be3c7/laptop.jpg 1320w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/c3b2b/laptop.jpg 3648w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/ee745/laptop.jpg\"\n            alt=\"The story behind Samvedna Wellbeing\"\n            title=\"\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p>When I started therapy I was certain of following things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I NEEDED something to change,</li>\n<li>I was suffering,</li>\n<li>I didn’t feel connected to who I was, and</li>\n<li>I was uncertain of how to make decisions or where to start.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Therapy was life changing. It sparked healing and a process of unraveling and rebuilding.</p>\n<p>Along with my job as a teacher at Fountainhead School, I started my studies for Psychology. I did my Masters in Psychology specializing in counseling. I self-studied hours a day for years followed by practical experience in the counseling center. I’m grateful to my mentors who supported me.  And in the process, I have become a new version of myself. A version of myself that had hope, clarity and possibility.</p>\n<p>Suffering and dealing with my own turmoil head-on inspires me to reach out to the masses and support them. It gives me immense satisfaction to help someone in their recovery.</p>\n<p>On my journey of transformation, I realized how embracing my own suffering brings wisdom and joy in life. Without mud there would be no lotus. Similarly, you can transform your suffering to become the rich compost from which the real you will emerge. With this vision, Samvedna Well-being was born. Discovering and experiencing your own truth. I started Samvedna Well-being in 2019 with the motto of spreading Mental Health awareness, connecting with and supporting people on a wider scale. Samvedna Well-being aims to acknowledge, accept, and bloom from within towards the light!</p>\n<p>Currently, I’m a certified CBT, TEAM CBT, Existential therapist and an IB DP Psychology Educator. I have not limited myself to one form of therapy in my counseling process. I have been given the opportunity to live my life with purpose. I  believe in living a balanced lifestyle, striving towards mental and emotional wellbeing, continual growth, and existing in accordance with one’s true self.</p>\n<p>My message for everyone is to- not to give up on your dreams. It is okay to start late. I trust that you will question, take what’s for you, and leave what isn’t. Most importantly have patience and perseverance throughout the journey.</p>","categories":["Story"],"date":"March 17, 2020","description":"How the story of Samvedna Wellbeing was written and how it came to be what it is today.","id":"75a524aa-7b85-59b6-9bc5-a2f068b9bf58","keywords":["Inception","Venture","Entrepreneurship","Blog"],"slug":"/blog/the-story-behind-samvedna-wellbeing/","title":"The story behind Samvedna Wellbeing","readingTime":{"text":"4 min read"}},"listingPagePath":"/blog"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3262260831","948380417"],"slicesMap":{}}

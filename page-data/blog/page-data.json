Be aware of your physical body. Perhaps first the outer area of your body, like your feet and legs, your arms and hands, and then sense the contact of your body with whatever you’re sitting on. Now bring awareness into the middle part of your body, sensing your throat, and your chest, and your belly.</li>\n<li>Ask yourself the question: “What is occupying my attention right now?” or “How do I feel right now?” or “How is my life going? What are the main things for me right now?” or you could start with: “What is keeping me from feeling an open inner space at this time?”</li>\n<li>Notice everything that comes to your mind and what you observe in your body… Don’t go into anything right now. Recognize whatever comes up as it arises. When some concern comes, do not go into it. Just say “Yes, that’s there. I can feel that, there.”</li>\n<li>You can write on a piece of paper some keywords. Acknowledge everything just the way it is. Write down a few words on the topics that come to your attention. Take the time you need for it.</li>\n<li>You can then allow yourself the opportunity to put each of these things aside. You can literally make that movement in reality by placing the paper you wrote on, at a distance. Continue this process until you have acknowledged and written down all the various things, and found a place for them. The ‘right place’ to put something aside may be at a small or a large distance from yourself, depending on what your feelings tell you to do. Do not hesitate to change things until you feel that it is ‘right’.</li>\n<li>Observe how you feel inside after putting all the papers aside. Feel whether you now have an open inner space.</li>\n<li>You may also write down a keyword or a phrase or an image to capture the experience of ‘having inner space’.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this, you are in a state where you can feel all your senses and the way you are feeling. Making space helps you detach from your worries and capture the experience of attaining being with your true self. Go back each time you are ready to focus your mind over new thoughts and have an acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>Link for making space exercise is attached below:-</p>\n<p>Reference:-</p>\n<p>Artwork By:- Twinkle Bardolia (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/the.fanartressy/\">https://www.instagram.com/the.fanartressy/</a>)</p>\n<p>Making Space – Existential Wellbeing Counseling: A Person-centered Experiential Approach Course by Mia Lejissen.</p>","categories":["Mental Health"],"date":"November 06, 2020","description":"Making space helps you detach from your worries and capture the experience of attaining being with your true self.","id":"de8050b1-4559-5755-acf1-0647ea3a0bfa","keywords":["Mental Health","Mental Health Exercise","Blog"],"slug":"/blog/making-space/","title":"Making Space","readingTime":{"text":"4 min read"}},{"banner":{"alt":"Are you anxious or worried?","caption":"Why it is essential to know what state you are in how it can be dealt with accordingly and effectively.","src":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8c8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/91671/notepad.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/7e3b4/notepad.jpg 165w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/47f88/notepad.jpg 330w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/91671/notepad.jpg 660w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/5aaff/notepad.jpg 1320w","sizes":"(min-width: 660px) 660px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/322ad/notepad.webp 165w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/de3b3/notepad.webp 330w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/2b2b5/notepad.webp 660w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/e36a7/notepad.webp 1320w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 660px) 660px, 100vw"}]},"width":660,"height":400}}}},"body":"<p>We are always in a loop of confusion whether we are anxious or worried in certain situations. Everyone at some level feels anxious in unpleasant situations but it’s important to know how extreme the feeling is.</p>\n<p>Anxiety is a diffuse, unpleasant, vague sense of apprehension. It’s often a response to an imprecise or unknown threat such as the uneasiness you might feel walking down a dark street alone. Anxiety is a psychological disorder. Diagnosable anxiety disorder is when a person’s anxiety level rises enough to rapidly decrease performance and cause impairment. It’s a severe, persistent worry that is excessive for the situation, and extreme avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 660px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 67.87878787878788%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/c9b55/notepad.webp 165w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/f2908/notepad.webp 330w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/cc661/notepad.webp 660w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/a66df/notepad.webp 990w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/d33d4/notepad.webp 1320w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/e72c3/notepad.webp 3000w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/27f9f/notepad.jpg 165w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/80fc7/notepad.jpg 330w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/ee745/notepad.jpg 660w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/4017f/notepad.jpg 990w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/be3c7/notepad.jpg 1320w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/12609/notepad.jpg 3000w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/ee745/notepad.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Are you anxious or worried?\"\n            title=\"\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Worry or fear on another, do not negatively interfere with the daily routine. Worry can help you in certain situations for problem-solving or push you to work hard. And it creates mild emotional distress which is temporary.</p>\n<p>For instance, awaiting examination results can lead to worry which is a normal response. But when this very worry gives a major impact on physical as well as psychological wellbeing at an extreme level then it’s anxiety-provoking or a person feeling anxious.</p>\n<p>Not all anxiety is terrible or extreme. Some are at a low level and have a mild effect on mind and body, which can lead to a confusion of worry or anxiety. But it’s important to know that worry affects the mind and is a normative psychological state which is for a time being. Anxiety affects the whole body; mentally and physically. It is considered as a true mental disorder, which can be medically/therapeutically treated under professionals.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 660px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 150.3030303030303%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/c9b55/laptop.webp 165w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/f2908/laptop.webp 330w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/cc661/laptop.webp 660w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/a66df/laptop.webp 990w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/d33d4/laptop.webp 1320w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/26eaf/laptop.webp 3648w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/27f9f/laptop.jpg 165w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/80fc7/laptop.jpg 330w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/ee745/laptop.jpg 660w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/4017f/laptop.jpg 990w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/be3c7/laptop.jpg 1320w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/c3b2b/laptop.jpg 3648w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/ee745/laptop.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Are you anxious or worried?\"\n            title=\"\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Here in this image, GAD is General anxiety disorder, wherein all the factors like sleep, fatigue, arousal, irritability, muscle tension etc occur and affect a person.</p>\n<p>Whereas, this image presents that worry affects the mind and happens during uncertainty which again fuels to generate worry.

Have you ever felt unworthy? Have you ever felt consumed by anxiety or panic attacks? I have.</p>\n<p>Since childhood, I’ve been an avid reader. As a child, I was living a life of denial. I used to hide behind the books. I was told to aspire and dream within boundaries. Although I was a bright student in academics, I didn’t know what to do in my life. Under peer pressure and family’s influence, I pursued my career in Chartered Accountancy and Company secretary. I cleared both the stages of CA in the first attempt but only in the final year of my internship and job experience in Pune I hit the rock bottom and realized, this is not what I can do my whole life. I was frustrated and completely lost.</p>\n<p>I returned to my city and stayed in depression for months, unable to find meaning in life. I’m grateful for that night when I was exploring on the internet something I can do worthwhile. I got to know about the vacancy in the only IB school of Surat which strives for change in the education system. That was the platform where I started questioning everything I thought I knew about life. I questioned my existence, religion and everything around me.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 660px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 67.87878787878788%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/c9b55/notepad.webp 165w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/f2908/notepad.webp 330w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/cc661/notepad.webp 660w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/a66df/notepad.webp 990w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/d33d4/notepad.webp 1320w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/e72c3/notepad.webp 3000w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/27f9f/notepad.jpg 165w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/80fc7/notepad.jpg 330w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/ee745/notepad.jpg 660w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/4017f/notepad.jpg 990w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/be3c7/notepad.jpg 1320w,\n/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/12609/notepad.jpg 3000w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/1d7b0d0d6e7b145f968f65bfc40a39b4/ee745/notepad.jpg\"\n            alt=\"The story behind Samvedna Wellbeing\"\n            title=\"The story behind [Samvedna Wellbeing](https://samvednawellbeing.org/).\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\"><p>The story behind <a href=\"https://samvednawellbeing.org/\">Samvedna Wellbeing</a>.</p></figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>So much of the root of the cause of our suffering has come from being conditioned in environments where our realities are denied. For a long time, I thought I was an expert at coping in my life. What made me feel this way was my ability to lie to myself and dwell in denial. In return, I was making decisions rooted in fear, insecurity, and old wounds. I was in a vicious cycle of coping and self-sabotage.</p>\n<p>As I was always fascinated with psychology readings to know myself, to know how these thoughts, feelings and emotions work. I took a huge leap of courage to drop all my previous pursuits and embark on the journey of self-exploration. I contemplated my solo travels and quiet times. I decided to seek help, to experience the therapy, how it can be helpful in my trauma recovery of early childhood.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 660px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 150.3030303030303%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/c9b55/laptop.webp 165w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/f2908/laptop.webp 330w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/cc661/laptop.webp 660w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/a66df/laptop.webp 990w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/d33d4/laptop.webp 1320w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/26eaf/laptop.webp 3648w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/27f9f/laptop.jpg 165w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/80fc7/laptop.jpg 330w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/ee745/laptop.jpg 660w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/4017f/laptop.jpg 990w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/be3c7/laptop.jpg 1320w,\n/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/c3b2b/laptop.jpg 3648w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/ae4c393892c33ee4431b5ba607b9788e/ee745/laptop.jpg\"\n            alt=\"The story behind Samvedna Wellbeing\"\n            title=\"\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p>When I started therapy I was certain of following things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I NEEDED something to change,</li>\n<li>I was suffering,</li>\n<li>I didn’t feel connected to who I was, and</li>\n<li>I was uncertain of how to make decisions or where to start.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Therapy was life changing. It sparked healing and a process of unraveling and rebuilding.</p>\n<p>Along with my job as a teacher at Fountainhead School, I started my studies for Psychology. I did my Masters in Psychology specializing in counseling. I self-studied hours a day for years followed by practical experience in the counseling center. I’m grateful to my mentors who supported me.  And in the process, I have become a new version of myself. A version of myself that had hope, clarity and possibility.</p>\n<p>Suffering and dealing with my own turmoil head-on inspires me to reach out to the masses and support them. It gives me immense satisfaction to help someone in their recovery.</p>\n<p>On my journey of transformation, I realized how embracing my own suffering brings wisdom and joy in life. Without mud there would be no lotus. Similarly, you can transform your suffering to become the rich compost from which the real you will emerge. With this vision, Samvedna Well-being was born. Discovering and experiencing your own truth. I started Samvedna Well-being in 2019 with the motto of spreading Mental Health awareness, connecting with and supporting people on a wider scale. Samvedna Well-being aims to acknowledge, accept, and bloom from within towards the light!</p>\n<p>Currently, I’m a certified CBT, TEAM CBT, Existential therapist and an IB DP Psychology Educator. I have not limited myself to one form of therapy in my counseling process. I have been given the opportunity to live my life with purpose. I  believe in living a balanced lifestyle, striving towards mental and emotional wellbeing, continual growth, and existing in accordance with one’s true self.</p>\n<p>My message for everyone is to- not to give up on your dreams. It is okay to start late. I trust that you will question, take what’s for you, and leave what isn’t. Most importantly have patience and perseverance throughout the journey.</p>","categories":["Story"],"date":"March 17, 2020","description":"How the story of Samvedna Wellbeing was written and how it came to be what it is today.","id":"75a524aa-7b85-59b6-9bc5-a2f068b9bf58","keywords":["Inception","Venture","Entrepreneurship","Blog"],"slug":"/blog/the-story-behind-samvedna-wellbeing/","title":"The story behind Samvedna Wellbeing","readingTime":{"text":"4 min read"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["1094019748","460736852"],"slicesMap":{}}
